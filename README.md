# Introduction
<b>Dark Matter</b> (DM) is still an open problem in modern Physics. In order to study what DM is, it is necessary to take observations and ensure that the astrophysical data can be sorted out, separating real usable data from background noise. This projects uses Python and Machine Learning in order to classify those events.

# Project Description 
This project investigates the classification of events in dark matter searches, aiming to distinguish potential dark matter signals from astrophysical or instrumental background using supervised machine learning. Synthetic datasets are generated based on simplified but physically motivated models of observable quantities such as energy, direction, velocity, and position, and these features are used to train and evaluate classification algorithms. The workflow includes data simulation, exploratory analysis, model training, and statistical performance assessment, with an emphasis on interpretability and physical consistency to understand which observables drive the classification and under what conditions the method succeeds or fails.

# Adressed topics
- Dark matter detection
- Machine Learning
- Data generation
- Python applied on Physics

# Project status
The project is currently under development.

# Utilized technologies
Python 3, Jupyter Notebook.

# Conclusion
Machine Learning is a powerful tool that can be aplied to multiple Physics topics, specially when dealing with large amounts of data. In the case of dark matter, it is very important to declutter information regarding astrophysical observations, once DM indirect detection is still a strong possibility. Nowadays, developing computational algorithms to do so can help research extensively, once low-noise objects, such as dwarf galaxies, also contain the least amount of dark matter. This project is made mainly for the student's developing of computational and scientific skills, but can also highlight ML's importance on DM research.
